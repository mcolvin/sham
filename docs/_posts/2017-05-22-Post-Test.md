# Overview

A reference population of known pallid sturgeon abundance is needed to 
evaluate varying monitoring designs and their ability to achieve the 
fundamental objectives identified during the first population assessment 
program workshop. 




# Objectives

The objectives of this analysis were to:

1. Create a spatially explicit pallid sturgeon population with known
bend-level abundances, and
2. Simulate the reference population for 20 years with varying but known
survival and recruitment


# Methods

## Spatial extent and grain

This analysis was constrained to generate reference pallid sturgeon populations
for segments and bend within Missouri River RPMAs 2 and 4. Bends of varying length
were used to generate the spatial distribution of pallid sturgeon (Table 1).



## Creating a reference population

### Density formulation
We randomly assigned the number of pallid sturgeon occupying each bend given
reported segment level densities by origin (Table 2). The number of pallid sturgeon
assigned to a bend was stochastically generated from a Poisson distribution given the 
segment density accounting for bend length as:
